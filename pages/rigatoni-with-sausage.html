    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>1 lb Italian sausage (mild or spicy, casings removed)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Grated parmesan cheese (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the rigatoni according to the package instructions until
            al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
